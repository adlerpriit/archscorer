### page layout and hierarchy -- thoughts

Initial simple functionality should include

* Create competition
 * From template (Field, Hunter, Animal, etc)
 * Custom: [number of targets, arrows per target, how to score]

Site Needs to managed past and present competitions, site needs browse / search / blog function to
find competitions. Past competition scores could be private (only participants can see) or public.

* Add participants
 * by registration form (pre-filled for logged in user / can register others as well?)
* Arrange participants to targets (need some privileges)
 * By class / comp cum score / rating / manual
* Scoring
 * Show running score for the competition
 * Input end score - one arrow at a time, for each competitor at given end

All this requires some user management (Google/FB/email auth)
