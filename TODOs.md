# TODOs


* Arrow score -> not as integer but choice (select field) -- helps also in validation and allows visible text differ from value

* from carousel to v-windows with pagination


* https://github.com/rsinger86/drf-access-policy/ -- good idea before going public
* https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#djangomodelpermissions -- is another way to go

* Event list serializer should be separate to event-detail serializer. List serializer provides only top level information while
details also include results and additional information about rounds and participants.
