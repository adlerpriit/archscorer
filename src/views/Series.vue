          <p>This part of the site has not been developed yet. This is placeholder for
            future series page. Series page will allow to get overview of competition
            series as well for privileged users to create new ones. Mostly same rules
            apply as with events.</p>
          <p>Series is collection of archery events i.e. Club Cup, or any other cup
            for that matter. Within series creator will denote how each event is
            scored (how many first places get points, which clubs are allowed, how
            many events are obigatory for final ranking in series, etc.)</p>
          <p>This page is not in the priority list atm. It will not be needed before
            late spring 2020, so this is approximate deadline</p>
